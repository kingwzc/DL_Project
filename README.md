# DL_Project
Deep learning project

Since the data and model part are too large, thus we put google drive link here for you to check~ Sorry for the inconvenience :)

We need to put data and model under the directory of DL_Project (DL_Project/)

data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18lxoxQrSl8wb1Vk8edprl2kD4l2_FMgj?usp=sharing

model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lrItNxUieTO2RpFDO_ZJ7N9_hoA44Box?usp=sharing


Here still exists serveral pth files and we need to put them into right directory.

1. put the rep_net3.pth file under the directory of DL_Project (DL_Project/):

2. put rep_net3.pth, road_map_unet.pth, box_detect_SSL.pth file under the directory of test (DL_Peoject/test)

The main function of the project is the Final_submission.ipynb in the file "test".

Please have fun~
